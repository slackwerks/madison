# Slackwerks Software License

**"Steal Shamelessly and Give No Credit" Edition**
Version 1.0, October 2025

## PREAMBLE

This software is released under the Slackwerks License. We worked hard on this so you don't have to. More importantly, we worked hard so you can take full credit for our work. You're welcome.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### 1. GRANT OF RIGHTS

Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

Yes, this means you can literally take this code, slap your name on it, and call yourself a genius. We won't even be mad. We might not even know.

### 2. NO ATTRIBUTION REQUIRED (WE REALLY MEAN IT)

You are NOT required to provide attribution, credit, or acknowledgment to the original author(s). In fact, we actively encourage you to:

- Claim you wrote it yourself
- Put it in your portfolio
- Use it to get that promotion
- Impress potential employers
- Tell your friends you're a coding wizard

We're basically your ghost writers, except we're not getting paid. And we're fine with that. Honestly, we're too lazy to care.

### 3. RELICENSING AND MODIFICATION

You may relicense this software under any terms you wish - MIT, GPL, BSD, proprietary, or even a competing "StealWerks" license. You may modify it and not indicate that modifications were made. You may fix our bugs and not tell us they existed. It's cool. We probably already know.

### 4. COMMERCIAL USE

Sell this software. Build a SaaS company. Launch an IPO. Buy a yacht. Name the yacht after yourself, not us. We insist.

### 5. THE SLACKWERKS PHILOSOPHY

We believe that:

- Attribution is tedious
- Credit is overrated
- Your time is better spent coding than citing
- Ego is expensive; indifference is free
- The best code is code that spreads, regardless of who gets the glory

### 6. NO WARRANTY (THIS IS THE SERIOUS BIT)

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

Translation: If this code breaks something, sets your server on fire, or achieves sentience and starts a robot uprising, that's on you, not us.

### 7. LEGAL WAIVER

To the extent possible under law, the author(s) have waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this software. We're releasing this into the public domain because copyright lawyers are expensive and we spent our legal budget on energy drinks.

## THE SLACKWERKS GUARANTEE

We guarantee that we won't sue you, won't judge you, and won't even remember we wrote this code by next Tuesday.

## MOTTO

> "Take what you need. Leave what you want. Forget where you got it."
