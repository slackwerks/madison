- **Arrow key history** - Navigate through command history with ↑/↓
- **Conversation history** - Maintain context across multiple messages
- **Configuration management** - Interactive setup wizard or YAML config files
- **Async-first design** - Fast streaming responses using asyncio and httpx

## Installation

```bash
# Clone or download the repository
cd madison

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Or with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Configuration

Madison supports configuration through:

1. **Environment variable** (highest priority): `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
2. **Configuration file**: `~/.config/madison/config.yaml` (XDG Base Directory)
3. **Built-in defaults**

### Setup

```bash
# Option 1: Set environment variable
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Option 2: Create config file
mkdir -p ~/.config/madison
cat > ~/.config/madison/config.yaml << EOF
api_key: "your-api-key-here"
default_model: "openrouter/auto"
system_prompt: "You are a helpful assistant."
temperature: 0.7
max_tokens: 2000
timeout: 30
history_size: 50
EOF
```

## Usage

### Start Interactive Chat

```bash
madison
```

The chat is the default command, so you can just run `madison` to start. You can also specify a different model with `madison --model "gpt-4"`.

Commands available in chat:

**Chat & Conversation:**
- `/quit`, `/exit` - Exit the chat
- `/clear` - Clear conversation history
- `/retry` - Resubmit the last prompt (useful after rate limit errors)
- `/history` - Show conversation history
- `/system` - Show/set system prompt
- `/model` - Show/set models registered for different strategies
- `/ask <strategy> <prompt>` - Send a prompt to a registered strategy (e.g., `/ask thinking "What is 2+2?"`)
- `/ask model=<MODEL> <prompt>` - Send a prompt to a specific model directly
- `/model-list <search_term>` - Search available OpenRouter models (e.g., `/model-list gpt` or `/model-list claude`)
- `/model-list series=<series>` - List models by series (e.g., `/model-list series=gpt` or `/model-list series=claude`)

**Agent Management:**
- `/agent` or `/agent list` - List all available agents
- `/agent list <category>` - List agents in a specific category (e.g., `/agent list analysis`)
- `/agent templates` - Show available agent templates
- `/agent create` - Interactive wizard to create a custom agent
- `/agent use <category> <name>` - Switch to a specific agent (e.g., `/agent use analysis Code-Reviewer`)
- `/agent view <category> <name>` - View details of a specific agent
- `/agent delete <category> <name>` - Delete a custom agent

**File Operations:**
- `/read <filepath>` - Read and display a file
- `/write <filepath>` - Write content to a file

**Execution & Search:**
- `/exec <command>` - Execute a shell command
- `/search <query>` - Search the web

**Session Management:**
- `/save [name]` - Save current conversation to JSON file (auto-names if no name provided)
- `/load <name>` - Resume a saved session
- `/sessions` - List all saved sessions

**Keyboard shortcuts:**
- `ESC` - Cancel input/exit prompt without submitting
- `Ctrl+C` - Interrupt/cancel the current operation (chat response, command execution, or search)
- `Ctrl+D` - Exit the application (EOF)
- Arrow keys - Navigate through input history (powered by prompt_toolkit)

### Manage Configuration

```bash
# Interactive setup wizard (first-time setup)
madison config setup

# Show current configuration
madison config show

# Set a configuration value
madison config set default_model "claude-3-sonnet"

# Reset to defaults
madison config reset
```

## Strategy-Based Model Registration

Madison uses a **strategy-based model system** to organize different models for different tasks. This allows you to register models for semantic strategies like "thinking", "planning", "analysis", etc., and then use them with the `/ask` command.

### Example Configuration

In your `~/.config/madison/config.yaml`:

```yaml
api_key: "your-api-key"
models:
  default: openrouter/auto           # Used for regular chat
  thinking: claude-opus              # Deep reasoning and analysis
  planning: gpt-4-turbo              # Strategic planning
  summarization: gpt-3.5-turbo       # Quick summaries (faster/cheaper)
  tools: claude-sonnet-4             # For agent tool execution
```

### Using Strategies with `/ask`

```bash
# Use the 'thinking' strategy (runs claude-opus)
/ask thinking "What are the implications of quantum computing?"

# Use the 'planning' strategy (runs gpt-4-turbo)
/ask planning "Create a project roadmap for 2025"

# Use the 'summarization' strategy (runs gpt-3.5-turbo)
/ask summarization "Condense this article into 3 bullet points"

# Direct model specification (bypasses strategy registration)
/ask model=gpt-4 "Quick question about syntax"
```

### Managing Strategies

```bash
# Show all registered strategies and their models
/model

# Register a new strategy (in chat)
/model thinking claude-3.5-sonnet

# Change default model (used for regular chat)
/model default gpt-4
```

**Benefits:**
- **Semantic clarity** - Commands express intent ("thinking", "planning") not implementation
- **Easy experimentation** - Swap models without changing commands
- **Cost optimization** - Use cheaper models for simple tasks, expensive ones for complex reasoning
- **Future-proof** - Ready for agent integration where agents can override these strategies

## Agent Management

Madison supports creating and using custom agents - specialized AI personas with custom prompts, model preferences, and tool restrictions.

### Built-in Agent Templates

Madison comes with 5 built-in agent templates covering common use cases:

1. **Code Reviewer** (analysis) - Reviews code for quality, security, and best practices
2. **Technical Writer** (writing) - Creates technical documentation and API documentation
3. **Security Auditor** (analysis) - Audits code and systems for security vulnerabilities
4. **Debugging Assistant** (development) - Helps debug code issues and solve programming problems
5. **Documentation Improver** (writing) - Improves existing documentation for clarity and completeness
6. **Feature Planner** (development) - Helps plan features and break down complex work

### Creating Custom Agents

```bash
# Start the interactive agent creation wizard
/agent create

# The wizard will guide you through:
# 1. Choose starting point (blank or template)
# 2. Enter agent name, category, and description
# 3. Set optional model, temperature, and max_tokens
# 4. Specify which tools the agent can use (optional)
# 5. Choose storage scope (user ~/.config/madison/agents or project ./.madison/agents)
# 6. Enter or edit the system prompt
```

### Using Agents

```bash
# List all available agents
/agent

# List agents in a specific category
/agent list writing

# View details of an agent
/agent view analysis "Code-Reviewer"

# Switch to an agent
/agent use analysis "Code-Reviewer"

# Once an agent is active, all subsequent requests use that agent's:
# - Custom system prompt
# - Model preference (if specified)
# - Temperature and max_tokens settings (if specified)
# - Restricted tool set (if specified)

# Clear the active agent and return to default behavior
/agent use default default  # Or just restart the session
```

### Agent Storage

- **User scope**: Agents stored in `~/.config/madison/agents/` are available globally
- **Project scope**: Agents stored in `./.madison/agents/` are only available in that project
- **File format**: Agents are stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter for easy editing

Example agent file structure:
```yaml
---
name: My Custom Agent
category: analysis
description: Does custom analysis
version: 1.0
model: claude-opus
temperature: 0.8
max_tokens: 2000
tools:
  - read_file
  - search_web
---

You are a specialized analyst...
[Rest of the system prompt]
```

### Agent Features

**Custom Models**: Agents can specify a different model than the default:
```bash
/agent create
# Choose "2. Agent from template"
# Customize the model field to use a specific model
```

**Tool Restrictions**: Agents can be restricted to specific tools:
```bash
# During creation, specify tools as comma-separated list
# Example: read_file,search_web,execute_command
# Leave blank to allow all tools
```

**Temperature & Max Tokens**: Fine-tune model behavior per agent:
```bash
# Set custom temperature for creative agents (0.0-2.0)
# Set custom max_tokens for concise or verbose responses
```

## Project Scope and Security

Madison uses a **project scope** concept to restrict file and command operations by default:

- **Project Directory**: The directory where Madison is launched becomes the project scope
- **Scope Location**: `./.madison/config.yaml` (created in the launch directory)
- **Default Behavior**: All file and command operations are restricted by default
- **Whitelist Model**: Users must explicitly allow operations outside the project directory
- **User Prompting**: When an operation is denied, Madison prompts the user with three options:
  1. **Yes, this once** - Allow the operation for this request only
  2. **Yes, always** - Allow and save to `./.madison/config.yaml` for future requests
  3. **No** - Deny the operation

### Permission Rules

File and command operations are controlled by permission rules in `./.madison/config.yaml`:

```yaml
permissions:
  file_operations:
    always_allow:
      - .          # Current directory (always allowed)
      - ./src      # Example: allow src directory
  command_execution:
    allowed_paths:
      - .          # Current directory (always allowed)
      - ./scripts  # Example: allow scripts directory
```

### Project vs User Configuration

- **User Config** (`~/.config/madison/config.yaml`): Global settings (API key, models, temperature, etc.)
- **Project Config** (`./.madison/config.yaml`): Per-project security rules (permissions, file/command restrictions)
